Changing the whole system, also you have to make product and person stable before finishing the system.

Person is also become user

The User (The big one, admin, can see the whole system)
The Person (The medium one, can see the person and associated product)
The Product (The small one, can only see the product and have list of person)
Then lets do this! 

Problems bruh: 

Request get the personId
But the personId is not the same as the userId
Also the personId is not become List of PersonId

GetPersonId-> Turn it into ListOfPerson, like record it as list of person.



I should do the mapping correctly.
Also somehow list of persons is still NULL, I should fix this.
